# Parentheses

This assignment was to practice using stacks, while learning about stacks, queues, and bags. This is a basic practice problem for deciding whether or not the parenthetical input is balanced or not, which is a precursor to understanding how mathematical operations are handled by the interpreter. By using stacks and understanding how PEMDAS is implemented in programs.

## Parentheses.java

Although not necessary for the operation that is taking place, a parentheses object can be made to store the parenthetical string and whether or not it is balanced or not. The test client within the class shows that either Parentheses objects can be made or just simply using the determineBalance method without creating an object.
