# Binary Search Tree Traversal

After learning about the Binary Search Tree, our assignment was to traverse the tree. In class we were only showed how each traversal should look like without finding out the code. In this assignment we had to copy the entire BST class from the algs4 library and add in the three traversals directly into the class. The three traversals in question are: 

- Inorder
- Preorder
- Postorder

You can see my recursive implementation of these traversals in the BST.java file within the src folder.   

Disclaimer: The only code that I wrote and added to the file was past line 530 in the file. Everything else was copied from the algs4 implementation of it.    

Side-Note: We were told to implement the traversals recursively but I am aware that it can also be done by using a stack.
