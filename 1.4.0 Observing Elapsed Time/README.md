# Observing Elapsed Time

This was an assignment to quantify the differences between algorithms that vary in efficiency

## PrimeNumbers

The base method for comparison is PrimeNumbers(int). This method is a very slow and inefficient way to find the number of prime numbers between 0 and n. 

## EfficientPrimeNumbers

The more efficient method that is used to compare against PrimeNumbers(int) is EfficientPrimeNumbers(int). When comparing results, it is obvious this is much faster. This method specifically uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm which is why it is so much faster.
