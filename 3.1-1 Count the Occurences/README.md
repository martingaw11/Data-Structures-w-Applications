# Counting the Occurences

Symbol Tables were the main topic of this assignment, or dictionaries from Python is how I first learned about them. In this assignment we were to use the symbol table provided by the algs4 library.

## Objective

The entire assignment was a test client in which the program takes in either an entire book or section of a book and then count the occurence of each word and then print out the amount of occurences of each word. The books tested consisted of: 

- *A Tale of Two Cities* by Charles Dickens
- *The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes* by Arthur Conan Doyle
- *The Count of Monte Cristo* by Alexandre Dumas and Auguste Maquet
- *Moby Dick* by Herman Melville
- *A Time Machine* by H. G. Wells

You can find the results in: /bin/output/...

The nuances of this project is that words have been separated by spaces, tabs and nextlines; also, I decided to separate hyphenated words.
